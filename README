Description:

  TTS stands for Trajectory-Tracking Scheme, which is trying to be designed as
  a practical fully Lagrangian linear advection scheme for atmospheric modeling.
  The continuous air or tracer field is discretized as parcel polygons with
  finite number. The parcels are advected passively by the background wind field
  provided by other components of an atmospheric model (i.e., dynamical core).
  During the advection, the shape of a parcel polygon will be deformed
  (severely) according to the wind. A curvature guard algorithm has been devised
  to keep good approximation to the continuous curved interface of the parcel by
  discrete straight lines.
